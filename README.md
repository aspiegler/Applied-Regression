# Preface

---


*Exploring Linear Regression* is a set of interactive course materials designed to explore linear regression. These materials are Open Education Resources (OER) designed to serve as in-class labs for MATH 4387/5387: Applied Linear Regression at University of Colorado Denver. 


## How to Access an Edit Documents

---

An html version of the text can be accessed at <https://aspiegler.github.io/Applied-Regression/>. Since the html version is not dynamic, students will not be able edit the text or run code in the html version. However, each section of the text has a link to a Quarto document (.qmd) that you can download and edit locally using RStudio or other software for editing and rendering Quarto documents. The Quarto file used to generate each static html file can be downloaded by clicking on Code Links located beneath the Table of Contents in the left side panel.


Some sections may also have a Jupyter notebook version that you can open and edit using Google Colaboratory.


[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Statistical-Theory/blob/main/Chap1/00-Getting-Started-with-Rstudio.ipynb)  


- At the top of each notebook is a "button" such as the one above.
- Click the button to open an interactive Jupyter notebook version initialized to run R code in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or Colab).
- You can begin working with the notebook right away in Colab! There is no software to install (or purchase!).
- You can also access the materials directly on GitHub at <https://github.com/aspiegler/Applied-Regression.git>.


Quarto source materials contain both narrative text (formatted using Markdown) and R code chunks that you can create, modify, and run. In order to edit and run Quarto documents locally, you will need to have R and RStudio installed locally on your computer. Both are freely available.



## A Virtual Lab for Exploring Statistics

---

These materials are intended as set of activities to experiment and explore regression analysis. Quarto document is a "virtual laboratory" where we perform our experiments and summarize the results. The objectives of experimental mathematics/statistics are generally to make the subject <font color="dodgerblue">**more tangible, lively and fun.**</font>


## What Programming Background is Required?

---


No prior experience or knowledge of R, Markdown, LaTeX, or RStudio is assumed or required to begin working with these materials. After working with these materials, you will have some knowledge and experience with R, Markdown, LaTeX, and RStudio!


- Here's a link to [Getting Started with RStudio](https://aspiegler.github.io/Applied-Regression/00-Getting-Started-with-Rstudio.html)
- Here's a helpful [Markdown guide](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb).


### What is R?

---

[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is a programming language used largely for statistical computing, data wrangling and visualization. We will be using R as a tool for exploring statistical theory.  The first stable version of R was released in 2000, and after all of this time, there is a large community of R users that have already created tons of useful packages and shared interesting data sets that are frequently updated. We will create, modify, and run R code in Jupyter notebooks. **No prior programming experience is required to begin working in R in these materials.**



### What is LaTex?

---

[LaTeX](https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf) is a system for rendering nice looking mathematical symbols, expressions, and equations. All of the mathematical notation in these materials are created using LaTeX. You can view and edit all of the LaTeX code in the Markdown cells. You do not need to become an expert in LaTeX, but having a familiarity with LaTeX is quite helpful and LaTeX can be used to typeset math in a number of different applications.

- Here is a useful [dictionary of LaTeX math symbols](https://www.cmor-faculty.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf) to get a glimpse of LaTeX.
